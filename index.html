And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.</p>

I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.</p>

We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured.</p>
